Files used to build Ubuntu Flatpak Remix 22.10

## Coming Soon
Currently, no builds or scripts for 22.10 exist. This will be developed after 22.04 stabilizes.

Note: Once Ubuntu 23.04 stabilizes, that should be preferred for intermediary releases. Support should be for current LTS and current Intermediary (open to discussion, of course).
